The elaboration of the design failed. This file here give hints
how to debug the failure. You may also refer to the SystemC chapter
of the VCS user guide.

The design has SystemC-on-top-HDL down. It is elaborated in two phases.
The first phase contains a partial simulation that contains just 
the SystemC but no HDL parts. This partial simulation was executed
and failed unexpectedly.

Some possible reasons for the failure:
- an error from the SystemC kernel, for example incomplete port bindings
- a SEGV/crash in user C++ code, for example accessing a NULL pointer
- the sc_main() function returned with a status other than 0, for 
  example because the argc/argv arguments are not as expected
- the SystemC module constructors were not executed for some other reason

The design cannot simulation as usual because it is not properly elaborated.
But you can debug the design in order to identify and fix the issue that
broke the SystemC part.

To reproduce the error, follow these steps:
  /bin/mv .elab.error 
  setenv SYSTEMC_ELAB_ONLY 1
  

To debug the error with gdb, follow these steps:
  /bin/mv .elab.error 
  /home/ares/synopsys/vcs/linux64/bin/cbug-gdb-64/bin/gdb --args 

In gdb type:
  set environ SYSTEMC_ELAB_ONLY=1
  directory /home/ares/synopsys/vcs/etc/cbug
  break cbug_stop_here
  run

Function cbug_stop_here(...) is called when the SystemC kernel is 
emitting an error. It is also called in some other situations.

Note that neither UCLI, CBug nor DVEcan be used because the simulation
is not yet fully elaborated.
